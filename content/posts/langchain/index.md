In the dynamic world of AI and ML, there's a constant quest for tools that make life easier for developers. Tools that not only boost productivity but also speed up the journey from idea to final product. Meet LangChain and Streamlit â€“ two powerful platforms that, when combined, can supercharge your AI development process.

[LangChain](https://www.langchain.com), an open-source development framework available for Python and JavaScript, offers a seamless way to integrate large language models into applications, while [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io) provides an intuitive framework for creating interactive web applications with minimal effort. Together, they form a solid duo that can transform the way you approach AI development.

Here are some examples of web applications whose development can be eased considerably by using LangChain and Streamlit:

- **Chatbots**: With LangChain, customer service chatbots can grasp user queries and formulate detailed responses using a company's specific data. Streamlit ensures these chatbots are seamlessly deployed as web applications.

- **Document Summarization**: LangChain aids in creating tools that summarize extensive documents, benefiting areas like research, customer support, and marketing.

- **Machine Translation**: LangChain allows for the development of applications that translate text between languages, simplifying international communication.

- **Code Generation**: Need code on-the-go? LangChain has the capability. Combined with Streamlit, users can generate code without the need for a separate IDE or editor.

- **Data Analysis Tools**: LangChain offers tools for in-depth data analysis. With Streamlit's deployment, these tools become web-accessible, available to anyone, anywhere.

- **Agentic Applications**: LangChain facilitates the development of apps that can plan and execute tasks according to the users' requests, like personal assistants with the capability of booking flights and hotels, ordering food, or sending emails.

Let's delve into two real web applications developed using LangChain and Streamlit, each showcasing a different facet of what's possible when these platforms are harnessed effectively.

## HTML Chatbot: Converse with your HTML Files

Using LangChain and Streamlit, an HTML Query Chatbot has been developed to simplify the task of searching through personal HTML files. You can interact with a chatbot interface to quickly locate specific content within your documents, eliminating the need for manual file-by-file searches.

The following video shows how the application works:

In the video demonstration, it's clear that the HTML file being accessed is stored directly on the user's computer. Additionally, the chatbot retains a memory of past conversations, allowing users to refer back to previous interactions. Interested in trying it out? Check out the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/philico-tech/langchain-ask-your-htmls) hosting the application. There, you'll discover a README file detailing every step to install and launch the application in your browser.

## English Enhancer: Tailor Text to Audience Preferences

The English Enhancer is a user-friendly web application designed to tailor text based on specific criteria: tone (whether formal or informal) and English variant (American or British). It's a practical solution for refining emails to match the intended audience's expectations.

The following video shows the application running:
